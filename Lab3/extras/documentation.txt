Lab: https://github.com/EmanuelClaudiu/FLCD/tree/main/Lab3 (by 'Lab3' I mean the lab from week #3)

Models: SymbolTable, BinarySearchTree, Node

Node: 
    An object containing data about the token, a link to the right child, and a link to the left child (None if no child)

BinarySearchTree:
    A binary search tree data structure with a root node, that implements the add and search functionalities.
    Each node contains a token that is greater that the token of the left child, and smaller that the token of the right child.
    Tokens from the nodes are compared alfabetically.

SymbolTable:
    Symbol table that implements the insert and search operations, on top of the BST.
    There is only one instance of ST for both the identifiers and the constants.
